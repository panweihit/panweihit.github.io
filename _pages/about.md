I am a [Senior Lecturer](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/wei.pan.html) (Associate Professor) in [Machine Learning](https://www.idsai.manchester.ac.uk/research/centre-for-ai-fundamentals/) at the Department of Computer Science and a member of [Centre for AI Fundamentals](https://ai-fundamentals.github.io/) and [Centre for Robotics and AI](https://www.robotics.manchester.ac.uk/), The University of Manchester, UK. I lead teaching in [UKRI AI CDT on Decision Making for Complex Systems](https://www.ai-decisions-cdt.ac.uk). I am an [ELLIS Scholar](https://ellis.eu/fellows) in the [ELLIS Unit Manchester](https://www.ellismcr.org). Before that, I was an [Assistant Professor](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/wei.pan/) in Robot Dynamics at the Department of Cognitive Robotics and co-director of [Delft SELF AI Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/self-lab?languageSelect=UK&searchCriteria[0][key]=keywords&searchCriteria[0][values][]=SELFLab&searchCriteria[1][key]=Resultsperpage&searchCriteria[1][values][]=50), TU Delft, Netherlands and a Project Leader at [DJI](http://www.dji.com), China. I am an Area Chair or Associate Editor of IEEE T-RO, IEEE RA-L ([outstanding AE award](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l/ra-l-distinguished-service-awards)), ACM TOPML, RSS, CoRL, L4DC, ICRA, IROS. I received my degrees from Imperial College London, University of Science and Technology of China and Harbin Institute of Technology.

I have a broad interest in (multi)robot control using Bayesian machine learning and the principles of dynamic control.
